# keet-hypertrace-logger

When debugging is enabled for keet, logs can be sent to a `hyperdht` server. This is that server.

This will take those logs and store in a .log file. That log file should then be read by promtail, which will store it.

## How to run

Run the server

```
$ node index.js
server started on 17ba5b10a5abba269e16d740c1eb76ba215c05a697c7e37c996abfcc48ba82f3
```

The public+secret key pair is generated by `keet-hypertrace-logger` and stored in `keys.dat`. This can also be updated if you have some specific key you need to use.

The log file is called the name of the public key. So in this case `17ba5b10a5abba269e16d740c1eb76ba215c05a697c7e37c996abfcc48ba82f3.log`.
